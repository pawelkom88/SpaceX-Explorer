# SpaceX Explorer: My Learning Journey

import { Badge } from '@/components/ui/badge'

<Badge variant="outline">Learning Project</Badge>

This project is a personal learning endeavor to explore and gain hands-on experience with modern web development tools and technologies, including:

- React
- GraphQL
- Apollo Client
- Material UI
- TypeScript

## Project Overview

The SpaceX Explorer app utilizes the SpaceX GraphQL API to display information about launches, rockets, and missions. It serves as a playground for me to:

1. Practice querying a GraphQL API
2. Implement Apollo Client for state management
3. Create responsive UI components with Material UI
4. Apply TypeScript for enhanced type safety

## Key Learning Objectives

- [ ] Set up a React project with TypeScript
- [ ] Integrate Apollo Client for GraphQL operations
- [ ] Generate TypeScript types from GraphQL schema
- [ ] Develop reusable UI components with Material UI
- [ ] Implement efficient data fetching and caching strategies

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run generate # Generate TypeScript types from GraphQL schema
npm start
```

## Notes

This project is not intended for production use. It's a sandbox for experimenting with the aforementioned technologies and may contain incomplete features or non-optimized code as I learn and iterate.

Feel free to explore the code and suggest improvements!
